;; Building a simplicial complex in Javaplex
;; ---------------------------------------------
;; To build a simplicial complex in Javaplex we simply build a stream in which all filtration values are zero. First we create an empty explicit simplex stream. Many command lines in this tutorial will end with a semicolon to supress unwanted output.

;; >> stream = api.Plex4.createExplicitSimplexStream();
;; Next we add simplicies using the methods addVertex and addElement. The first creates a vertex with a specified index, and the second creates a k-simplex (for k >0) with the specified array of vertices. Since we don't specify any filtration values, by default all added simplices will have filtration value zero.

;; >> stream.addVertex(0);
;; >> stream.addVertex(1);
;; >> stream.addVertex(2);
;; >> stream.addElement([0, 1]);
;; >> stream.addElement([0, 2]);
;; >> stream.addElement([1, 2]);
;; >> stream.finalizeStream();
;; After we are done building the complex, calling the method finalizeStream is necessary before working with this complex!

;; We print the total number of simplices in the complex.

;; >> num_simplices = stream.getSize()
;; num_simplices = 6
;; We create an object that will compute the homology of our complex. The first input parameter 3 indicates that homology will be computed in dimensions 0, 1, and 2 â€” that is, in all dimensions strictly less than 3. The second input 2 means that we will compute homology with Z/2Z coefficients, and this input can be any prime number.

;; >> persistence = api.Plex4.getModularSimplicialAlgorithm(3, 2);
;; We compute and print the intervals.

;; >> intervals = persistence.computeIntervals(stream) 
;; intervals = 

;; Dimension: 1 
;; [0.0, infinity) 
;; Dimension: 0 
;; [0.0, infinity)
;; This gives us the expected Betti numbers Betti0=1 and Betti1=1.

;; The persistence algorithm computing intervals can also find a representative cycle for each interval. However, there is no guarantee that the produced representative will be geometrically nice.

;; >> intervals = persistence.computeAnnotatedIntervals(stream)
;; intervals 

;; Dimension: 1
;; [0.0, infinity): [1,2] + [0,2] + [0,1]
;; Dimension: 0
;; [0.0, infinity): [0]
;; A representative cycle generating the single 0-dimensional homology class is [0], and a representative cycle generating the single 1-dimensional homology class is [1,2] + [0,2] + [0,1].










;; 9-sphere example. Let's build a 9-sphere, which is homeomorphic to the boundary of a 10-simplex. First we add a single 10-simplex to an empty explicit simplex stream. The result is not a simplicial complex because it does not contain the faces of the 10-simplex. We add all faces using the method ensureAllFaces. Then, we remove the 10-simplex using the method removeElementIfPresent. What remains is the boundary of a 10-simplex, that is, a 9-sphere.

;; >> dimension = 9; 
;; >> stream = api.Plex4.createExplicitSimplexStream(); 
;; >> stream.addElement(0:(dimension + 1)); 
;; >> stream.ensureAllFaces(); 
;; >> stream.removeElementIfPresent(0:(dimension + 1)); 
;; >> stream.finalizeStream(); 
;; In the above, the finalizeStream method is used to ensure that the stream has been fully constructed and is ready for consumption by a persistence algorithm. It should be called every time after you build an explicit simplex stream.

;; We print the total number of simplices in the complex.

;; >> num_simplices = stream.getSize()
;; num_simplices = 2046
;; We get the persistence algorithm

;; persistence = api.Plex4.getModularSimplicialAlgorithm(dimension + 1, 2);
;; and compute and print the intervals.

;; >> intervals = persistence.computeIntervals(stream) 
;; intervals = 

;; Dimension: 9
;; [0.0, infinity)
;; Dimension: 0
;; [0.0, infinity)
;; This gives us the expected Betti numbers Betti0=1 and Betti9=1.




;; Representative cycles
;; ------------------------------

;; Quote,
;; The persistence algorithm computing intervals can also find a representative cycle for each interval. However, there is no guarantee that the produced representative will be geometrically nice.

;; >> intervals = persistence.computeAnnotatedIntervals(stream)
;; intervals

;; Dimension: 1
;; [0.0, infinity): [1,2] + [0,2] + [0,1]
;; Dimension: 0
;; [0.0, infinity): [0]
;; A representative cycle generating the single 0-dimensional homology class is [0], and a representative cycle generating the single 1-dimensional homology class is [1,2] + [0,2] + [0,1].

;; This isn't it
#_(defn annotated-intervals [kom]
    (let [plex (build-complex kom)]
      (.computeAnnotatedIntervals (simplicial-algorithm (dim kom)) plex)))

;; Try computing a representative cycle for each barcode.

;; >> intervals = persistence.computeAnnotatedIntervals(stream)
;; We don't display the output from this command in the tutorial, because the representative 9-cycle is very long and contains all eleven 9-simplices.
